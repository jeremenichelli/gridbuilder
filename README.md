# Grid Builder

This is a tool to help you calculate fluid grids very easily.

You can choose the number of columns you want, the gap between columns in percents and pressing a button you can see the styles you're going to need and a preview of your grid.

Go to this page to use it [https://jeremenichelli.github.io/gridbuilder](https://jeremenichelli.github.io/gridbuilder).

If you feel that something is not working good, or could work better, or if there's something you feel it could improve this tool race the issue here. Thanks!
